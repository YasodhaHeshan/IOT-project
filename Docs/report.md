## Introduction

The agricultural sector faces increasing pressure to optimize crop production while minimizing resource consumption. Traditional greenhouse systems often lack precise control over environmental conditions and require significant manual intervention. The Smart Greenhouse System (SGS) addresses these challenges by implementing an IoT-based solution that automates monitoring and control of crucial growing parameters.

### Problem Statement

Traditional greenhouse management faces several challenges:

- **Inconsistent environmental conditions**: Traditional greenhouses often struggle to maintain stable environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and light levels, which are crucial for optimal plant growth. Fluctuations in these parameters can lead to suboptimal growth and reduced crop yields.

- **Inefficient resource utilization**: Manual control of greenhouse systems can lead to inefficient use of resources like water, energy, and nutrients. Overuse or underuse of these resources not only increases operational costs but also impacts the sustainability of agricultural practices.

- **Limited remote monitoring capabilities**: Traditional systems lack the ability to monitor and control greenhouse conditions remotely. This limitation makes it difficult for growers to respond promptly to changing conditions or emergencies, potentially leading to crop damage.

- **Manual intervention requirements**: The need for constant manual intervention to adjust environmental parameters and manage plant care increases labor costs and the risk of human error. This can result in inconsistent care and negatively affect plant health.

- **Lack of data-driven decision making**: Without automated data collection and analysis, growers miss out on valuable insights that could help optimize growing conditions and improve crop yields. Data-driven decision making is essential for modern, efficient agricultural practices.

### Project Objectives

1. **Design and implement an automated greenhouse monitoring system**: The primary objective is to create a system that can continuously monitor key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels. This system will utilize various sensors to collect data and ensure optimal growing conditions for plants.

2. **Develop efficient control mechanisms for environmental parameters**: The project aims to develop control algorithms that can automatically adjust environmental conditions based on sensor data. This includes controlling actuators like water pumps, ventilation fans, and lighting systems to maintain ideal conditions for plant growth.

3. **Create a user-friendly mobile interface for remote management**: To enhance user convenience, the project will include the development of a mobile application that allows users to remotely monitor and control the greenhouse environment. The app will provide real-time data visualization and control options, making it easy for users to manage the system from anywhere.

4. **Establish a reliable data collection and analysis system**: A robust data collection framework will be implemented to store and analyze the data collected from sensors. This system will leverage cloud computing capabilities to ensure data is securely stored and easily accessible for analysis, enabling data-driven decision making.

5. **Optimize resource usage through smart algorithms**: The project will focus on developing algorithms that optimize the use of resources such as water and energy. By analyzing sensor data and environmental conditions, these algorithms will ensure that resources are used efficiently, reducing waste and operational costs.

### Hardware Implementation

The system utilizes the following components:

- **NodeMCU ESP8266/ESP32 as the main controller**: These microcontrollers serve as the central processing units of the system, handling data collection from sensors, executing control algorithms, and communicating with the cloud for data storage and remote access.

- **DHT22 sensors for temperature and humidity monitoring**: These sensors provide accurate measurements of temperature and humidity levels within the greenhouse. The data collected is crucial for maintaining optimal growing conditions and triggering automated control actions.

- **Soil moisture sensors**: These sensors measure the moisture content in the soil, ensuring that plants receive the right amount of water. The data helps in automating irrigation processes, preventing both overwatering and underwatering.

- **Light-dependent resistors (LDR)**: LDRs are used to monitor light intensity in the greenhouse. This information is essential for controlling artificial lighting systems to supplement natural light, ensuring plants receive adequate light for photosynthesis.

- **Relay modules for actuator control**: Relay modules act as switches that control various actuators such as water pumps, ventilation fans, and lighting systems. They enable the system to execute control actions based on sensor data and predefined thresholds.

- **Water pumps and ventilation fans**: These actuators are responsible for regulating water supply and air circulation within the greenhouse. Water pumps ensure efficient irrigation, while ventilation fans help maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels by promoting air exchange.
